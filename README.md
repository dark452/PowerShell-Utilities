# PowerShell Utilities

## Description
To be able to perform automate tasks with Microsoft tools/technologies like AD, AAD, Azure, Teams, etc. I've created some basic script to help me out on this matter.

### Directory Layout
Initially i've created the following structure:

```
+---PowerShell-Utilities
|   +--- AD
|   |   +--- File1.ps1
|   |   +--- File2.ps1
|   +--- Azure
|   |   +--- File1.ps1
|   |   +--- File2.ps1
```
